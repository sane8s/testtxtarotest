<h1>How to Join TARO</h1>
<p>If you are an institution interested in participating in TARO , you need to  submit an email letter of interest to the Chair of the TARO Steering Committee (Amanda Focke) by May 31 (for a July start) or
November 30 (for a January start).</p>

<p>Letters of interest should include:
<ul>
<li>Submission of sample EAD finding aid</li>
<li>Description of the collections</li>
<li>Current mode of creating finding aids, including the degree of EAD adoption, if any</li>
<li>Designated contact person</li>
<li>Evidence of a web presence</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>Applications will be reviewed by the TARO Steering Committee in June and December to assess the level of technical support required to onboard new members, the commitment to EAD encoding, and the description of collections.</p>

<p>Repositories that have received state and federal funding for collections processing will receive priority consideration. The number of new applicants accepted to TARO per year will vary according to the current capacity of new applicants and TARO’s capacity to manage its resources and multiple new partners.</p>

<p>As a general practice, new members will begin twice a year (July and January) in cohorts, with variations possible as current TARO initiatives and staffing allow.</p>
