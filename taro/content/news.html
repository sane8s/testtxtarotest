		<p>Hello TARO Community,</p>
<p>Earlier this year the TARO Standards Subcommittee shared with you that we have been tasked with assessing the level of adoption of the <a href="http://texastaro.pbworks.com/w/file/fetch/113029186/TARO_EADbpg.pdf">TARO Best Practice Guidelines</a>, among other things. You can check out the <a href="http://texastaro.pbworks.com/w/page/103437425/Standards%20welcome%20page">Standards wiki page</a> to learn about what our group has been doing this past year.</p>
<p>This message is to ask you to share your thoughts with us. Let us know what you think of the TARO Best Practice Guidelines, both what you like and what you donâ€™t like. We want to know if you are using the best practice guidelines document, and if you are not, to learn why.</p>
<p>You can provide your feedback by completing this brief <a href="https://goo.gl/forms/DbnMrSn7htpNElyj1">survey</a>.</p>
<p><strong>You don&#8217;t have to be your repository&#8217;s designated TARO representative. If you create finding aids that are added to TARO, we want to hear from you! </strong></p>
